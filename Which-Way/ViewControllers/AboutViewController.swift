        Which Way? is an app made as part of the OSU Hackathon project, Sept 10-13th.

        The focus on the hackathon is "health" which I took as promoting healthy lifestyles by encouraging fitness. This app addresses the issue of not being able to find the golf flag (or pin) while on a course. Sometimes there are hills, trees, or other obstacls that block view of exactly where the pin is located. This helps the golfer orient toward the flag.

        This app was made by Ed Wied, a fair amount of coffee, and his trusty orange cat Starbuck
